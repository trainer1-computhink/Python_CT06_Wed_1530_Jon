# Lesson 8 - Importing Libraries, Boolean & Conditions

## Recap 1: Product of 5 numbers

Write a program to calculate the product (multiplication) of 5
numbers.

1. Using a for loop, ask the user for 5 numbers one at a time.
2. Calculate the multiplication for these 5 numbers and print
   it out.
   
---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 1: 'time' library

**Task 1a**:
Import the 'time' library and make use of the 'time.sleep()'
function to create a 10 seconds countdown timer that counts
to 1, printing the number of seconds remaining every second.

**Task 1b**:
Modify your code from Task 1a to include an 'input()' function
asking the user for the number to countdown from, before
counting down every second from the number given by the user.

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 2: 'random' library

**Task 2a**:
Import the 'random' library and create a program that randomly
output a number between 1 to 6

**Task 2b**:
Using the 'random' library, create 20 numbers between 0 and
9999 randomly.

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 3: Print Boolean Value & Condition

**Task 3a**:
Assign a boolean value to a variable and print it.

**Task 3b**:
Create 2 variables both holding the "True" boolean.
Print out the result of comparing the 2 variables using
the "==" operator.

**Task 3c**:
Now, assign 1 variable the "True" boolean, and assign another
variable the "False" boolean.

Print out the result of comparing the 2 variables using
the "==" operator.

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 4:

**Task 4a**: Math Question Generator
Using the 'random' library, generate 2 numbers between 1 and 50
that the user must add together.

The output should be one of the following:
1. True (If the answer is correct)
2. False (If the answer is wrong)

Example:
What is 2 + 5? << 7 >>
True

**Task 4b**: Range Guesser
Create a program that generates a random number between 1 and
50.

The user should input a range (two numbers: start and end).

The program checks if the random number falls within the user's
range.

The output should be one of the following:
1. True (If the answer is correct)
2. False (If the answer is wrong)

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 5: Random Number Guessing Game

Create a simple program to guess a random number:
a. Create a variable called 'guess' and assign a number that
   you are guessing
b. Create a variable called 'num1' and assign a random integer
   between 1 to 10.

Your program will check if 'guess' is equal to 'num1'.

The output should be one of the following:
1. True (If the answer is correct)
2. False (If the answer is wrong)

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 6: Random Multiplication Quiz

You have been tasked by Ms Tan, the Math teacher to create a
multiplication quiz.

Create a program that generates a certain number of random
multiplication questions.

Each question should involve multiplying 2 random numbers
between 1 and 10. The user should input the number of questions
they want to attempt.

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 7: Even or Odd Checker

Write a program that asks the user to enter a number. The
program then tells the user whether the number is even
(True) or odd (False).

Your program needs to:
1. Ask user for an integer input.
2. Check if there is any remainder when user input is divided
   by 2 (using '%').
3. Print 'True' if number is even, otherwise print 'False'.

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 8: Multiple Check Program

Create a program where the user enters 2 numbers. The
program then checks if the first number is a multiple of
the second number.

Your program needs to:
1. Get user to input 2 numbers.
2. Check if there is any remainder when number #1 is divided
   by number #2
3. Print 'True' if number #1 is a multiple of number #2,
   otherwise print 'False'.
