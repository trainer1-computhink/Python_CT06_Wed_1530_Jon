# Qns 1 Lists

groceries = ["apple", "banana", "coconut", "pineapple", "pear"]

# 1. Remove the item "banana" from the list.

# 2. After removing it, print the 2nd item in the list.

# 3. Add "dragon fruit" so that it appears immediately before "pineapple".
#    (You are not allowed to hardcode the index)

# 4. Ask the user to continuously input grocery items.
#    Each item should be added to the END of the list.
#    Stop when the user types "end".

# 5. Print all items in the list in this format:
#    1. apple
#    2. coconut
#    ...

# 6. Generate a random index based on the current list size.
#    Remove it from the list.
#    Print the item at that position.

# 7. Ask the user to search for an item.

#    If found:
#    Print:
#    "[item] is found at position [index]"

#    If not found:
#    Print:
#    "[item] is not in the list"


# Qns 2 If - elif - else and order of operations

# A reward system works as follows:

# 1. If the score is NOT between 0 and 100, print "Invalid score"

# 2. If the player is NOT banned AND score is above 89
#    OR the player is a member AND score is above 95,
#    print "Diamond reward"

# 3. If the score is above 74 AND (the player is a member OR has finished the game),
#    print "Gold reward"

# 4. If the score is above 49 AND the player is NOT banned,
#    print "Silver reward"

# 5. If the player is banned OR has NOT finished the game,
#    print "No reward"

# 6. Otherwise, print "Bronze reward"

# Ask the user for:
# - score
# - member status ("yes" / "no")
# - banned status ("yes" / "no")
# - finished game status ("yes" / "no")

# Important:
# - You must use and, or, not
# - You must use brackets where needed
# - The order of checking matters

# Test your program with:

# Case 1:
# score = 96, member = no, banned = no, finished = yes
# Expected: Diamond reward

# Case 2:
# score = 80, member = no, banned = no, finished = yes
# Expected: Gold reward

# Case 3:
# score = 80, member = no, banned = no, finished = no
# Expected: Silver reward

# Case 4:
# score = 60, member = no, banned = yes, finished = yes
# Expected: No reward

# Qns 3: Debug the Code

# This program should:
# 1. Ask the user to enter numbers
# 2. Stop when the user types "end"
# 3. Store ONLY numbers greater than 10
# 4. Print the total and average at the end
# 5. You are NOT allowed to remove any lines.
# 6. You can only MODIFY existing lines.

# copy and paste to start finish
# numbers = []

# while True
#     value = input("Enter number: ")

#     if value == "end":
#         break

#     if int(value) > 10:
#         numbers.append(value)

# total = 0

# for i in range(len(number)):
#     total = total + numbers[i]

# average = total / len(numbers)

# print("Total is: " + total)
# print("Average is: " + average)



# Qns 4: Debug the Code

# This program should:
# 1. Keep asking the user for a score
# 2. Stop when the user types "end"
# 3. Convert each valid score into an AL level
# 4. Store all AL results in a list
# 5. Print the final list
# 6. You are NOT allowed to remove any lines.
# 7. You can only MODIFY existing lines.

# al_list = []

# while True
# score = input("Enter score: ")

#     if score == "end"
#         break

#     if score < 0 or score > 100:
#         print("Invalid")

#     elif score > 89:
#         al = 1
#     elif score > 84:
#         al = 2
#     elif score > 79:
#         al = 3
#     elif score > 74:
#         al = 4
#     elif score > 64:
#         al = 5
#     elif score > 44:
#         al = 6
#     elif score > 19:
#         al = 7
#     else:
#         al = 8

#     al_list.append(a1)

# print("AL list: " + al_list)
